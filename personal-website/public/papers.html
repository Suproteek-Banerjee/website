        This manuscript presents a fully elaborated Module-LWE based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) optimized for resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Beyond providing formal IND-CPA and IND-CCA security, it delivers a comprehensive treatment of: (1) algorithmic construction and step-by-step derivation, (2) rationale for parameter selection, (3) side-channel aware C implementations with selectable arithmetic kernels (NTT, schoolbook, Karatsuba), (4) practical evaluation across Cortex-M, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Zero platforms, and (5) trade-offs between security, latency, memory footprint, and energy. This work serves as a reference guide for implementing provably secure lattice-based KEMs in heterogeneous IoT environments.
